# [‚è™ Prep Skills](/README.md)

Prep skills will serve you well outside of SkilStak‚Ñ¢. Some of them
are to prepare you for our rather unique way of learning‚Äîby doing
what the pros do. 

> üí¨ It is more than a little ironic that the most
> sensible way of learning employable skills is still considered rare
> these days.  (For example, GitHub is still banned in several school
> districts while corporate educational products are forced on students
> that will have no lasting value outside of their school.)

**üìñ As you complete the following in your workbook your instructor
will help you check them off.** You should have setup a Gmail before
you arrived at SkilStak‚Ñ¢.  The rest you will accomplish and go over
in class, but you can work on them anytime. They generally should be
done in order

## Be Willing and Able to Read, A Lot

![](/assets/reading.gif)

Congratulations you are reading this! The most important programming
skill is actually reading. Get as much practice as you can and make
sure to give your eyes a rest often by looking at something far away.

## Use Chrome Incognito

Chrome is the browser we use during this course. Incognito
(in-cog-NEE-to) is a way to use Chrome so that the person before
you or after you is not affected by what you do. The creators of
CodeCombat.com recommended that we use this to avoid having one
student do levels for the one before. We have found this works for
a lot of things, codeanywhere.com, codeacademy.com, piskelapp.com,
khanacademy.com and many more‚Äîespecially that use Google+ or GitHub
for logins. So here's how to do it.

![incognito](/assets/incognito.gif)
 
## Join Mailing List

You should have signed up for the mailing list at the bottom of your
location‚Äôs web page. Make sure you and your emergency contact are on
it.

The mailing list is one of the main ways to
[communicate](communications.md) with you are your parents about
changes, events and such. It is your responsibility to make sure
you and your parents know how to find these and read them.

### Checking Promotions Folder

Unfortunately the mail service that we use (mailchimp.com) is
automatically sent to the *Promotions* mail folder on Gmail. Here's
how to find it:

![promotions](/assets/promotions.png)

### Confirm Subscription

There will be an email in your main email folder that has something
like this in it. Click on *Accept*.

### Add Contact So Comes to Main Folder

## Create Google Gmail Account

![](/assets/gmail.png)

Having a Google account is an absolute essential today. There's no way
around it. Most web services and games have an option to login with
Google. There is also no email service that beats Gmail in its
ability to filter out spam, manage your inbox, and create multiple
accounts. ***You must have a Google Gmail account to be here,*** not
a Gmail account tied to a Yahoo or Hotmail address, but an *actual*
gmail account. Later, if you really want, you can forward your Gmail
to your other account (but we strongly recommend picking
a Gmail address to use for the rest of your technology life).

### 13 and Up

***If you are under 13 you are not legally allowed to have a Gmail
account.*** Your parents *are* allowed to have an account, however.
Your parents are the ones creating the account and they are the one
using it. This is important to accept and remember. If you are under
13 the Gmail account your parents create is theirs and they are
responsible for how it is used. If you ask really nicely they might
let you use it.

### Your Most Important Password

Gmail is the most important account and password information that you
remember. This is because you can forget the passwords and login
information to everything else and recover it rather simply by
providing your Gmail information that you used to create those
accounts.

When creating an account ***make sure you setup some sort of password
recovery option, preferrably a phone number.***

![](/assets/gmail-recovery.png)

### Multiple Gmail Accounts

One of the main reasons Gmail makes the most sense is its support of
*multiple gmail account names*.

A lot of people don't know that when you create a Gmail account you
are actually creating an infinite number of different email addresses
that you can use for everything and anything, but that all direct
email sent to any of them to the same, single account. For example,
all of the following will go to the same `youraccount@gmail.com`
account:

* `youraccount@gmail.com`
* `your.account@gmail.com`
* `y.o.u.r.a.c.c.o.u.n.t@gmail.com`
* `youraccount+py@gmail.com`
* `youraccount+js@gmail.com`
* `youraccount+whatever@gmail.com`

This is extremely useful when you need more than one account on
another service, like CodeCombat, Twitter, GitHub or whatever else.

## Join the Slack Chat Room

**The chat room is the most important thing for you to remember
from this class.** Everything else depends on it. **You should check
the chat at least once a week** to stay informed about what is going
on. If you forget how to get to it, go to the home page
([skilstak.io](http://skilstak.io)) and find your location. The
chat room is linked from there. If you have questions about anything
else, where something is, how to do it, if we are open, *everything*
is in there. **Each chat room is private for your location and you
can direct message anyone at the location including students and
staff.**

![](/assets/slack.png)

Slack is the leading chat tool used by businesses, schools,
open source development teams, organizations, and about everything
else. It comes with a great mobile app that makes communication in
chat as easy as text messages. This is no *made-for-education* chat
tool, it's a *real* tool used by professionals, which is the main
reason we require learning it. 

### Get an Invite

Because we use a private repo (for obvious reasons) you'll need an
invite from your instructor, teacher assistant, or location manager.
Here's what it looks like in your in box:

slack chat room.

## Understanding Core Offerings

If we were at Disney Land then *Core Offerings* we be our directional
pillar.  You know those ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù things with a star helping
you see where you fit into it all. So where is your star on our
directional pillar? At the entrance?

![](/assets/core-offerings.png)

Our offerings are divided into four levels or tiers:

1. Preparation
2. Proficiency
3. Project
4. Professional

Each has a general focus and different prices depending on the
location. (While we try to maintain our prices nationally we recognize
there are different costs of living depending on the location.)

### Level 1: Preparation

*[Play][]*, *[Prep][]*, *[Yoga][]*, and *[NewMedia][]* are all at
the *Preparation* level. Stuff here is designed to prepare and 
maintain your programming and other technical skills as you
build them. Before you ask, yes Yoga and YouTube are technical
skills. While *Yoga* and *NewMedia* are listed without connection
to anything they can be taken more than once, but are billed at the
*Preparation* tier. *Prep* and *Play* can also be taken more than once
but *Prep* is generally only needed for one semester (or less).

### Level 2: Proficiency

Proficiency means being able to show that you are able to do
something, that you are competent, that you know the Fundamentals
well. The greater your level of proficiency the closer you get to
mastery. The two *Fundamentals* courses at this level are designed
to help you get proficient in coding, either in *[Python][]* or
*[Web][]* depending on which *[technology path][]* you've chosen.

This level is where things start getting more serious, but fun. Each
90 minute course is divided into three parts:

1. 15 minutes: Homework Review and Help (CodeCombat, etc.)
2. 20 minutes: Instruction from Lesson
3. 40 minutes: Class Work
4. 15 minutes: [Digital Recess][] / [Fundamentals Projects][]

[Fundamentals Projects]: /sections/funproj.md
[Digital Recess]: https://github.com/skilstak/prep/blob/gh-pages/overview/README.md#digital-recess
[technology path]: #-pick-technology-path
[Play]: http://play.skilstak.io

Students are generally expected to work outside of class primarily on
their CodeCombat levels. The first part of class is to help you get
over those parts that you were stuck on over the week. You can also
ask in the chat as well when you get stuck. Sometimes having someone
there just helps the most.

The next part is to present the lesson material for the day. Then,
after questions and answers, you break to work on the lesson for
yourself in your subgroup with your TA.

The last part of class is the same *Digital Recess* as Prep,
but less. You are also encouraged to do one of the [Fundamentals
Projects][] instead.

> –ü–æ–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ ‚Äì –º–∞—Ç—å —É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è<br>
> Repetition is the mother of learning

Some may achieve proficiency in a month, others a year, others
longer.  There are a lot of things that are involved in how quickly
someone learns something. **The single biggest factor in learning
something is the amount of time practicing the activity.** This
means those who spend time outside of class working on stuff will
advance faster. The smallest factor is aptitude and intelligence.
Remember this. If you find yourself advancing more slowly than
someone else it is very unlikely it is because you are ‚Äúdumber‚Äù
than them. Instead you should look at how much time each day that
you are practicing and see if you can do more. It really is just
as simple as that. If you want to get good, you have to practice.
The sooner you learn that hard lesson the better.

#### Certified Mastery

You don‚Äôt leave the *Proficiency* level until you [certify][]
that you have gained proficiency in either *[Python][]* or
*[Web][]*. Think martial arts v.s. public school. You can‚Äôt
earn a belt just because you changed grades. In fact, the more you
think about it, the more you will realize any organization that is
setup to advance students based on age and grade on a certain time
table is, well, flawed. Everyone is different.

### Level 3: Project

This level is for **exploration and specialization**.  Montessori
has championed the idea that projects foster independence,
accountability, internal drive, and ownership of one‚Äôs own learning.
In that sense we agree a lot with the approach.

We have prepared learning modules (projects) for different *main
focus categories* and are constantly adding more. We also encourage
you to explore things by creating your own learning projects with
the help of your mentor/instructor. Each project will have its own
GitHub Classroom repo to archive and refer back to as well as a
listing in your [SkilStak IDP](http://idp.skilstak.io).

Project level courses can be taken repeatedly. Usually you will see
*Projects* on the weekly schedule when signing up. Sometimes you
will see one of the *main focus categories* instead (*Engineering*,
*Linux*, *Languages*, *Data*, *Apps*, *Game*). Students may register
for more than one time during the week and usually there is one day
during the week with two *Projects* slots back to back creating a
3-hour block for those that want to sign up for both.

#### Main Focus Categories

Currently there are five categories, each with a
[certification](http://certify.skilstak.io) prerequisite. Read more
details about each by following the links:

1. [Python][] -> [Engineering][]
1. [Python][] -> [Linux][]
1. [Python][] or [Web][] -> [Languages][]
1. [Python][] or [Web][] -> [Data][]
1. [Web][] -> [Apps][]
1. [Web][]  -> [Game][]

[Yoga]: http://yoga.skilstak.io
[NewMedia]: http://newmedia.skilstak.io
[Web]: http://webfun.skilstak.io
[Python]: http://pyfun.skilstak.io
[Engineering]: http://eng.skilstak.io
[Linux]: http://linux.skilstak.io
[Languages]: http://lang.skilstak.io
[Apps]: http://apps.skilstak.io
[Game]: http://game.skilstak.io
[Data]: http://data.skilstak.io
[certify]: http://certify.skilstak.io

Please don't confuse *main focus categories* with a course although
often students with a common focus category will be grouped together
in a *Projects* class for convenience. Sometimes one *Projects*
time will be dedicated to just one category and appear with that
category name on the schedule.

#### Custom Projects

In addition to the *main focus categories* we encouraged students
to come up with their own, (with the help of their mentor/instructor).
For example:

* Other Languages: Go, Node, Java, C/C++, Assembly, Swift, Ruby, Perl
* Ethical Hacking: Kali Linux, Penetration Testing, Certification
* Advanced Engineering with sensors, servos, solder and more
* Building computer clusters with Raspberry Pi
* LPIC Linux Professional Certification
* Retro Gameboy Pi
* Customized drones
* SolidWorks 3D modeling and printing
* 2D and 3D video games in Phaser, Unity and others
* Native Web apps with PhoneGap and React native
* Web APIs: Golang, Node
* Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaSQL
* Frontend frameworks: React, Redux, Angular, Ember
* OAUTH Authentication

One or more semesters of *Projects* courses prepares you well with
stuff to show off in your GitHub repo so the world knows you have
really solidify your mastery of programming and your specialization.
Eventually you might want to pitch one or more of your current or
future projects for the *Professional Incubator Program*.

### Level 4: Professionals

Currently there is only one course at this level: [*Professional Incubator
Program*][Pro]. 

The *Professional* level is for students who have mastered programming
and demonstrated it well during *Projects* classes and now need to
launch into higher education, entrepreneurship, or working for an
organization. In *Projects* you built and explored stuff mostly for
your own learning and curiosity, in *Pro* you work on **stuff that
benefits others**, a client, a community, an organization. You are
contributing, perhaps for free, perhaps not.

<b>You must be invited into *Professional.*</b> To get an invite prepare
a proposal and submit it to your location manager. Your location
manager will review it with staff and decide to accept or not. If not
accepted there is always *Projects*.

The main criteria for giving you an invite will be **how much your
manager personally wants to see your project completed** based on
the needs of your location, your local community, and abroad. Those
projects that provide the most value back to SkilStak and the local
community will almost always get invites provided you have the
fundamental skills to get started on it. Making a game would not
likely get an invite unless the game were educational or included
a tutorial about how to make it.

Projects that have been accepted include creating test prep software
for the public school system, working on open source projects,
creating a programming Summer camp curriculum, performing a security
analysis of an organization, writing a Slackbot to assist students,
and re-imaging laptops with Linux to use with afterschool programs.

It is important to understand that [expectations are different and
higher][expectations] for those at the *Professional* tier, and
that there are fewer spots available.

Pro carries the largest perk privilege of any offering: a free pass to
SkilStak anytime we are open and there is a seat. Not only do you come
on your time slot, but you can attend *any SkilStak course* with
advanced notice at any time for no extra cost. This is because once
approved we want to do everything in our power to help you succeed in
meeting your Pro project goals. This includes use of our lab, 3d
printer, AV equipment, tools, drawing tables, and special high-end
computers that might not be available to you otherwise.

## Digital Recess

![minecraft](/assets/minecraft1.gif)

*Digital Recess* is a term we came up with after watching students
look forward to the ‚Äúfree‚Äù time they have together to play on their
classroom computers together. Whether it be collaboratively building
in a Minecraft world, trying not to get gobbled up by their neighbor
in Agar.io, or working on mini-projects solo or together, this time
has become important not only to the students but to instructors.
What appears to just be play time, is exactly that, just play
time‚Äîbut together.

Students often have a lot of opportunity to play games at home,
alone. But digital recess gives them an opportunity to realize the
person they are playing the game with is **a person** sitting right
next to them. The importance of this lesson cannot be
overstated‚Äîespecially today.

Social skills, managing conflict and failure, and basic human
interaction actually happen because they are in the room with the
person they are playing with. Is this as good as running
around outside on the playground? Yes, but in a different way. This
helps reinforce *netiquette* by unconsciously reinforcing that the
avatar they are playing with has a person behind it, and in this
case, that person is sitting in the same room. Too often online
gaming is not the problem, it is the removal of that other person's
humanity by covering it up with an anonymous avatar. Digital recess
helps combat this in a fun way.

For instructors and teacher assistants this bit of time at the end
of class provides a moment to review the class together, provide
feedback, [pay staff rebates][rebates], and sometimes meet with a parent or
two briefly.
