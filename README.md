**Welcome to SkilStakâ„¢!** This Prep course gets you ready for
everything to come later. Some of the stuff in Prep might seem
boringâ€”but it is important, administrative stuff that will be referred
back to by you, instructors, and your parents for as long as you are
here. So please be patient and thorough.
