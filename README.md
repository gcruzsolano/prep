# [Preparing for Fundamentals](http://github.com/skilstak/prep-work)

[![why-code](/assets/why-code.png)](https://youtu.be/dU1xS07N-FA)

Welcome to Prep! Prep gets you ready for everything to come later.
Some of the stuff in Prep is boring—but important—administrative
stuff. Some of it is to get you ready to get more serious in [stuff
that comes later](http://offerings.skilstak.io). Some of it is
just to do stuff with technology and games that are just fun—even
educational. The great thing about coding is that it is really fun to
learn to create stuff.

Each 90-minute class is divided into three parts:

1. **30 minutes:** [CodeCombat](#codecombat)
2. **30 minutes:** [Prep Skills](#prep-skills) or [Extras](#extras)
3. **30 minutes:** [Digital Recess](#digital-recess)

## CodeCombat

![desert](/assets/desert.png)

[CodeCombat](http://codecombat.com) is a game where you basically
program a bot, your hero, to complete challenges in a fun, graphic
environment.  It’s crazy fun—but more importantly—it’s *real*
programming. For some reason when traditional educators get a hold
of something they have to make an “educational” version instead of
teaching the *actual* thing in a way that is approachable. Examples
of such “educational” things meant to teach programming that can
actually distract from learning real code include Scratch, Blockly,
Pascal, Logo, even Code.org.  There's nothing directly wrong with
these approaches except that they [don't teach real programming
syntax][real], at all. They teach “computational thinking,” but so
does math. Strictly speaking, [computational thinking is not the
programming][real]. You could be an astrophysicist with an extraordinary
capacity and ability for computational thinking and still not be
able to write a single line of code without knowing syntax—or more
importantly—how to structure a program in the target language of
your domain. To learn real programming you need to use the *actual*
language and idioms used by the industry ultimately in the way that
professionals use it.

## Prep Skills 

Prep skills will serve you well outside of SkilStak™. Some of them
are to prepare you for our rather unique way of learning—by doing
what the pros do. It is more than a little ironic that the most
sensible way of learning employable skills is still considered rare
these days.  (For example, GitHub is still banned in several school
districts while corporate educational products are forced on students
that will have no lasting value outside of their school.)

As you complete the following your instructor will help you check
them off in the markdown source:

Like everything here, you only have to stay in something long enough
to prove you know it to move on, no waiting around for the next
semester, even the next week. You move immediately when you want to
and you can prove you are ready.

## Digital Recess

![minecraft](/assets/minecraft1.gif)

*Digital Recess* is a term we came up with after watching students
look forward to the “free” time they have together to play on their
classroom computers together. Whether it be collaboratively building
in a Minecraft world, trying not to get gobbled up by their neighbor
in Agar.io, or working on mini-projects solo or together, this time
has become important not only to the students but to instructors.
What appears to just be play time, is exactly that, just play
time—but together.

Students often have a lot of opportunity to play games at home,
alone. But digital recess gives them an opportunity to realize the
person they are playing the game with is **a person** sitting right
next to them. The important of this lesson cannot be
overstated—especially today.

Social skills, managing conflict and failure, and basic human
interaction actually happen because they are in the room with the
person they are playing with. Is this as good as running
around outside on the playground? Yes, but in a different way. This
helps reinforce *netiquette* by unconsciously reinforcing that the
avatar they are playing with has a person behind it, and in this
case, that person is sitting in the same room. Too often online
gaming is not the problem, it is the removal of that other person's
humanity by covering it up with an anonymous avatar. Digital recess
helps combat this in a fun way.

For instructors and teacher assistants this bit of time at the end of
class provides a moment to review the class together, provide
feedback, pay, and sometimes meet with a parent or two briefly.

## Prep Mini-Projects
