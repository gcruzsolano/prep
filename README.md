**Welcome to SkilStak™!** This Prep course gets you ready for
everything to come later. Some of the stuff in Prep might seem
boring—but it is important, administrative stuff that will be referred
back to by you, instructors, and your parents for as long as you are
here. So please be patient and thorough. 

## What is Prep? 

Each 90-minute class is divided into three parts:

1. **30 minutes:** [CodeCombat](#codecombat)
2. **30 minutes:** [Prep Skills](#prep-skills) or [Extras](#extras)
3. **30 minutes:** [Digital Recess](#digital-recess)

We will go over them more on the first day as described on this
page. The [Prep Skills](#prep-skills) directly prepare you to
continue on to [Fundamentals in Python](http://pyfun.skilstak.io)
or [Fundamentals in Web](http://webfun.skilstak.io) depending on
your chosen [technology path](/sections/path.md). These are the main reason
you are here. Please make sure you learn them well and know how to
look them up later if you forget.

## Why Code?

Before we talk about anything else let’s watch a great video produced
by [Code.org](http://code.org) about what “coding” is and why it matters. It is a little cheesy for our taste, but worth it.

## CodeCombat

[CodeCombat](http://codecombat.com) is a game where you basically
program a bot, your hero, to complete challenges in a fun, graphic
environment.  It’s crazy fun—but more importantly—it’s *real*
programming. Do as much CodeCombat as you can during class and outside
of class. Those who work the most on it outside of class tend to
progress the fastest. The first part of every class is dedicated to
helping you through CodeCombat.

Ironically CodeCombat has been forbidden by some schools as “a game”
(no I am not kidding). It is almost as if some educators refuse to
allow learning to be fun. Well that ain’t us. 

> For some reason when traditional educators get a hold of something
> they have to make an “educational” version instead of teaching the
> *actual* thing in a way that is approachable. Examples of such
> “educational” things meant to teach programming that can actually
> distract from learning real code include Scratch, Blockly, Pascal,
> Logo, even Code.org.  There's nothing directly wrong with these
> approaches except that they [don't teach real programming syntax][real],
> at all. They teach “computational thinking,” but so does math.
> Strictly speaking, [computational thinking is not the programming][real].
> You could be an astrophysicist with an extraordinary capacity and
> ability for computational thinking and still not be able to write
> a single line of code without knowing syntax—or more importantly—how
> to structure a program in the target language of your domain. To
> learn real programming you need to use the *actual* language and
> idioms used by the industry ultimately in the way that professionals
> use it.

## Prep Skills 

Prep skills will serve you well outside of SkilStak™. Some of them
are to prepare you for our rather unique way of learning—by doing
what the pros do. It is more than a little ironic that the most
sensible way of learning employable skills is still considered rare
these days.  (For example, GitHub is still banned in several school
districts while corporate educational products are forced on students
that will have no lasting value outside of their school.)

As you complete the following in your [workbook](/sections/work.md)
your instructor will help you check them off.

You should have setup a Gmail before you arrived at SkilStak™.  The
rest you will accomplish and go over in class, but you can work on
them anytime:

Like everything here, you only have to stay in something long enough
to prove you know it to move on, no waiting around for the next
semester, even the next week. You move immediately when you want to
and you can prove you are ready.

## Digital Recess

![minecraft](/assets/minecraft1.gif)

*Digital Recess* is a term we came up with after watching students
look forward to the “free” time they have together to play on their
classroom computers together. Whether it be collaboratively building
in a Minecraft world, trying not to get gobbled up by their neighbor
in Agar.io, or working on mini-projects solo or together, this time
has become important not only to the students but to instructors.
What appears to just be play time, is exactly that, just play
time—but together.

Students often have a lot of opportunity to play games at home,
alone. But digital recess gives them an opportunity to realize the
person they are playing the game with is **a person** sitting right
next to them. The importance of this lesson cannot be
overstated—especially today.

Social skills, managing conflict and failure, and basic human
interaction actually happen because they are in the room with the
person they are playing with. Is this as good as running
around outside on the playground? Yes, but in a different way. This
helps reinforce *netiquette* by unconsciously reinforcing that the
avatar they are playing with has a person behind it, and in this
case, that person is sitting in the same room. Too often online
gaming is not the problem, it is the removal of that other person's
humanity by covering it up with an anonymous avatar. Digital recess
helps combat this in a fun way.

For instructors and teacher assistants this bit of time at the end
of class provides a moment to review the class together, provide
feedback, [pay staff rebates][rebates], and sometimes meet with a parent or
two briefly.
