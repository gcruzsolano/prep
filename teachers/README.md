# Teachers’ Welcome

Thank you for using this textbook. It has an accompanying workbook
that should be used as a starter repo for a [GitHub Classroom][classroom].
You may wish you read more about using [*GitHub Classroom as Textbook
and Workbook*][text-work] to familiarize yourself with the approach.

## Age

The content is designed with students ages 8 to 18 in mind but has
been completed by college age students and adults as well.

## Rubrics

This course contains no rubrics since these differ greatly.
SkilStak™ we prefer to simply check for completion and supplement. The
workbook contains several review questions that students should answer
as they `x` off their skills.

## Resources and Requirements

Students need access to a **Bash command-line** on a computer that has
had **`python3`** installed. Usually this will be through an **`ssh`**
connection to a Linux account on a central school server but could
equally be done with [codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhere.com),
individual Raspberry Pi computers, personal Linux laptops, virtual
machines, or a remote virtual host such as [Digital
Ocean](http://digitalocean.com).

## Next Steps

After completing this course students are ready to begin either
SkilStak™ [Fundamentals in Python](http://pyfun.skilstak.io) or
[Fundamentals in Web](http://webfun.skilstak.io)
