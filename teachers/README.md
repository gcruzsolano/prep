# [🍎 Welcome Teachers!](/README.md)

Whether you are a SkilStak™ senior student who has become a student
instructor, a teacher from a public or private school, a university
adjunct, or even from a corporate organization we welcome you and
hope you find this material useful. Like all courses and
learning modules at SkilStak™ each has a ***textbook*** and ***workbook***
GitHub repo. The *textbook* is for reference. The *workbook* is to be
used as a starter “assignment” repo for [GitHub Classroom][classroom].
You may wish to read more about using [*GitHub Classroom as Textbook
and Workbook*][text-work] to familiarize yourself with this approach.
We believe it is the future of all textbooks in education as the
OER movement continues and classrooms become more digital.

## [⏫ Prerequisites](#table-of-contents)

* Be able to read
* Be able to use a keyboard and mouse
* Keyboard about 10 wpm

## [⏫ Age](#table-of-contents)

The content is designed with students ages 8 to 18 in mind but has
been completed by college age students and adults as well.

## [⏫ Time](#table-of-contents)

The amount of time required to pass off the prep skills depends on
the student’s work outside of class and age. Some students finish
all of the requirements in literally one 90-minute class. Others
spend more than two months. A few require and entire semester (16
weeks of 90-minute classes). Students always have the option of
remaining in Prep for the rest of the semester doing other activities
(under Extra) but can move into Fundamentals immediately when they
are ready if they wish.

## [⏫ Rubrics](#table-of-contents)

This course contains no rubrics since these differ greatly.
SkilStak™ we prefer to simply check for completion and supplement. The
workbook contains several review questions that students should answer
as they `x` off their skills.

## [⏫ Resources](#table-of-contents)

Students need access to a **Bash command-line** on a computer that has
had **`python3`** installed. Usually this will be through an **`ssh`**
connection to a Linux account on a central school server but could
equally be done with [codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhere.com),
individual Raspberry Pi computers, personal Linux laptops, virtual
machines, or a remote virtual host such as [Digital
Ocean](http://digitalocean.com).

## [⏫ Other](#table-of-contents)

Prep is an adjustment period. Students become acclimated to the
school, surroundings, students and instructors. Be very aware of this
adjustment and take care to ensure the first impression is a good one
and not frustration. There is a real danger of scaring students away
from programming if they are pushed too hard or not allowed a fair
amount of *digital recess* to offset the programming work they do.

Maintain a high aesthetic appeal in the classroom. The enticements of
the fun environment will keep students associating positive feelings
and experiences with their coding and peers. At SkilStak™ we strive to
make every classroom feel like a miniature Google-meets-MIT
environment full of visual appeal and cool gadgets they can eventually
make as they continue their learning.

## [⏫ Next](#table-of-contents)

After completing this course students are ready to begin either
SkilStak™ [Fundamentals in Python](http://pyfun.skilstak.io) or
[Fundamentals in Web](http://webfun.skilstak.io)
