# What is Coding?

[![](/assets/coding.png)][code]

Coding, programming, computer science, what do all these terms
means?

Coding is what happens when you write code. What's code?  Well,
this [Bloomberg article *What is Code?*][code] answers that best,
but the short answer is the stuff you type to make stuff happen on
the computer in a way that can be repeated.

## Coding or Programming?

To be purely pedantic, *coding* is **not** *programming*, but
*programming* ***is*** *coding*. HTML, for example, is Hyper-Text
**Markup** Language. It’s code, but its not programming. It’s like
a PDF document, it’s code to show how something should appear, but
their isn’t really logic.  *JavaScript*, on the other hand, *is*
programming.  When in doubt, if it doesn’t have an `if` statement it’s
probably not programming. We prefer the term coding because a lot
of coding is creating the framework and content for how stuff should
appear—especially web development.

## Programming is Not Computer Science

These terms get mixed up all the time. Most recently I heard about
a high school club changing its name from the “Coding Club” to
“Computer Science Club.” I am pretty sure they did not understand
the difference in terminology.

*Computer Science* is a term you will likely see in a University
course catalog. It is the study of what computers *can* do. Programming
is the study of *how* to make them do those things. Theoretically you
could get a PhD in computer science and never learn to program. And
there are thousands of amazingly good programmers who don’t know—and
do not need to know—a thing about computer science.

As Makinde says,

> A lot of the coding that people actually do is actually fairly
> simple. It’s more about the process of breaking down problems than
> coming up with complicated algorithms as people traditionally think
> about it.

So yeah, maybe you do need to be a genius to be a really good computer
scientist, just like you would need to be to be a great physicist, but
programming does *not* require you do be a genius at all.
