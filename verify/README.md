# [‚è™ Verify Your Ready](/README.md)

In order to leave *Prep* and move on to *Fundamentals* you will
need to first have an instructor or assistant help you check off
your workbook and then request that you go over it with your location
manager who can verify your work make the final decision about you
being ready to move on. The reason for this process is to ensure
that you will feel comfortable and challenged and that other students
will know that you have done the work necessary to keep up in class.
Everyone is always at a slightly different level, but this minimizes
any big gaps in your skills.
