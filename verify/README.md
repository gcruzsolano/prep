# [⏪ Verify to Move On](/README.md)

In order to leave *Prep* and move on to *Fundamentals* you will
need to first have an instructor or assistant help you check off
your workbook and then request that you go over it with your location
manager who will make the final decision about you being ready to
move on. The reason for this process is to ensure that you will feel
comfortable and challenged and that other students will know that you
have done the work necessary to keep up in class. Everyone is always
at a slightly different level, but this minimizes any big gaps in your
skills.
