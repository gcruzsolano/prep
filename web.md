# Create Your First Web Site

You should have already [created the GitHub repo for web site][web] when you
created your GitHub account. If not, go back and do that.

## Update Your `index.html` File

You should already have one. If not you'll have to [go make one][web].
The one we made when we created our GitHub account just had plain old
text in it. We are going to get a little fancy here, but nothing too
crazy.
