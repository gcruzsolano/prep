# Code and Play™

Code and Play™ gently introduces students to programming in a
camp-like environment. Each class has two parts: code and play (no
surprise there). 

## Code

Students spend the first half of every class learning in
[Code.org](http://code.org) and [CodeCombat.com](http://codecombat.com).
These are the same sites used by schools all over the world and can
be used at home as well.  This gives students and parents something
fun to work with outside of class and combines well with homeschooling,
afterschool, and Summer camp programs.

## Play

The second half of Code and Play™ is usually why students sign up, to
play Minecraft on our special SkilStak servers where each class gets
a server and can use special tools and powers like World Edit that
they normally could not use without a subscription to a public server
like Hypixel™ or Mineplex™. In fact, our Minecraft servers use the
same technology as these popular sites and students can eventually
learn to run their own servers.

## But Games?

Games counter frustration and keep students motivated. Students learn
best when they care about why they are learning the skills. We've had
students go from academic probation in their public school to the
honor roll because they learned to associate math and science with the
skills needed to make a really good game.

Minecraft is very educational with a rich command-line that strongly
encourages kids to learn to type, navigate their command-line history
and more. Some students actually type faster than their parents after
playing Minecraft a lot for a semester or two.

## Recommendations

The camp-like atmosphere and low-cost of Code and Play™ makes is great
'extra' course for students enrolled in other courses — including
older students — that want more time at SkilStak to have fun.
