# Organic Learning

Mother nature has a phenomenally awesome [pedagogy][]. As harsh as
natural selection seems to us it is well-tested and effective. When
something doesn't work it ends leaving the best to continue. Consider
the wildly complex solutions to problems that nature has solved in
an observable way. Trial and error, that is how nature arrives at
its best and that is how SkilStak and our students arrive at their
best. "Practice, practice, practice and all is coming." This method
involves a lot of repetition, experimentation, failure, and adaptation.
It also means none of us are ever finished improving and changing.
We own it. We'll forget a lot along the way and there is always
more to learn, always a better way to be discovered. There is no
"I'm finished", only "I'm finished for today".


## It's Messy

Learning this way is messy. We start out in Prep with some organized
approaches to get started, but the deeper learning comes as you let go
of organized assignments and even projects and begin experimenting.
Don't worry about it being clean and tidy at first. Just start coding,
start building something, and you can begin to shape your construction
as you go. This creative process is essential and the secret to not
only great ideas, but great art.

Later after your creation has taken form and you are sure you want to
continue down that path, you can fine tune it, refactor it, and make
is pretty.
