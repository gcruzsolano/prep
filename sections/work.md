# Understanding Textbook and Workbook Repos

The [textbook and workbook idea][tw] is a core principle at SkilStak™ and
you will encounter it a lot for every other course and learning
project. 

[tw]: https://blog.skilstak.io/github-as-text-book-and-work-book-828ffada9542#.sc1rmcnrt

Each class at SkilStak™ has a textbook repo (this one) and a workbook
repo, `prep-work`, which you can get to by clicking the title of
your textbook repo. There is only one textbook repo per course, but
everyone gets their own workbook, which is a exact copy of the starter
workbook.

***Your*** workbook is created by accepting the invite in the [Slack
chat room](/sections/slack.md) for your location. **DO NOT FORK THE
STARTER WORKBOOK REPO IN GITHUB!** Instead click on the pinned
invite in your `#prep` channel of Slack chat.

## What about changes?

Often changes are made to the textbook repo during your course.
That is fine. It is the very reason we are using GitHub.

> money selling overpriced, have-to-have, textbooks at $120 each that

> textbook” is an oxymoron today.

Most of the changes do not affect your workbook repo. When the
workbook repo changes, for example, maybe the order of stuff changes
and messes up the numbers, **you do not need to worry or change
your workbook when the starter workbook changes** unless you want
to or your instructor asks you to. These changes are very rare in
courses where the textbook has been around a while.

## Can I contribute?

**Absolutely!** If you see a way a concept could be explained
differently or maybe something has been left out completely you can
fork the textbook, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
In this way, students are literally SkilStak™ contributors as they
always have been. This is *your* school.
