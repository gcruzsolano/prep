# More About Why We Love CodeCombat

We are shocked that CodeCombat has actually been banned in some public
schools because, and I quote, “It is a game.” These same schools
promote code.org, (which is not real programming), and codeacademy,
which is full of job-stopping bugs and incorrect syntax, (which have
been reported and remain after seven years).

Here are some more reasons we *love* CodeCombat and think it is really
the best online learning resource for programming available to
students ages eight and up.

## Open Source

The source of [CodeCombat is completely open and
available][open] for anyone to use or modify as they wish. This is
a major reason we use CodeCombat. Everything we do is completely
available for free and we feel strongly in supporting those that
feel the same way whether it be CodeCombat, [FreeCodeCamp][], or
[MIT][].

[FreeCodeCamp]: http://freecodecamp.com
[MIT]: http://ocw.mit.edu

***Responsive Team of Developers:*** The team behind CodeCombat is
amazing and available pretty much constantly via their [public
developer chat channels][chat]. If you think you have found a bug
jump into the chat room and let them know.  They'll appreciate it.
In fact, the developers and architects are often available for a
phone conversation to discuss ways to make CoCo even better. This
is unfortunately a rare thing when it comes to a lot of educational
offerings out there.
