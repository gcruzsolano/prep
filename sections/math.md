# Understand Basic Algebra Math

Programming is called *Computer Science* or *Software Engineering*
for a reason, there is science and math involved. Programming is
much bigger than knowing where to put the parentheses. It is about
organizing solutions to problems. Finding the best and easiest way to
take the steps to do something. These are skills that math, science,
and engineering address.

## You Canâ€™t Program Without Math

So, what does this mean for you? It means you have to understand basic
Algebra math before taking Fundamentals. It does not matter how old
you are, only that you can organize basic match functions like this
one:

```
x = (2 x y) + 10
```

Or in computer symbols

```
x = (2*y) + 10
```

Another essential is understanding a grid system, you know, like that
you play with in CodeCombat or Battleship.

This kind of math is essential to even the most basic programming.

## How To Learn

There are a number of resources available online. Each appeals to
people differently depending on their age. Ask your instructor to
help you find one that matches your style.
