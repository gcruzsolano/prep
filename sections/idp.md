# Your Individual Development Plan (IDP)

After you have decided which [technology path](path.md) you would like
to head down initially you can fill in the details of how you are
going to get there. The fancy name for this plan is an *Individual
Development Plan* or *IDP*. Get used to it because that term will
likely be important to you your entire life as a technologist. Schools
use it. Businesses use it. Entrepreneurs use it. Why? Because having
a plan for what you want to develop about yourself immediately and
over the next year or two is critical to staying motivated and
focused. More importantly, if you do *not* have a plan you are at risk
of just letting your life and career *happen* to you instead of taking
charge of it.

## A Conversation

During class you will be going over these questions and reviewing them
personally to yourself. Then your instructor and TA will talk to you
about them as you come up with them. Think about them well but also
consider what you first reaction is, often it is the best:

* What do I want to make eventually?
* What are my weaknesses?
* What are my strengths?
* How much time outside of class do I have to work on stuff?
* What interests me?
* What would help me get a job I like someday?

As you think about these things capture them by writing them down in
your GitHub Classroom work repo.

## Goals

> You can’t get anywhere unless you know where you want to go.

Goals guide you. Without them you swerve all over the road. Here are
some things to help you set good ones:

* Is it specific?
* Is it measurable?
* Is it attainable and within my control?
* Is it relevant?
* Is it timed?

## Long Term Vision

Don’t worry if you don’t know what you want to do or be later, but
start to think about what you enjoy doing every day. What are you good
at *and* what makes you happy? This does not have to be a technical
skill or career path. In fact, for many of you technology will just be
something that enables what you *really* want to do with your life.  

Answer the following question and come back to this over time to
tweak it as you make changes. Be as specific as you can be and don’t
shy away from stuff that may seem silly. Remember, this is a private
repo that no one but you are your instructor can see. The neat thing
about using GitHub for this is that you can even track the versions
and moments in time when you changed your mind about something:

**What do you want to do with your life?**

## Come Back Often

You will be referring to this IDP a lot over your time here at
SkilStak™. Make adjustments as you explore and discover new directions
you want to include in your goals.
