# Create an Open Issue in GitHub

Issues (also sometimes called “tickets”) are how you keep track of
work and information related to your GitHub project repo. We use these
a lot to communicate about work in the course. It is a good habit to
get into because that is the same most open source and other GitHub
projects work.
