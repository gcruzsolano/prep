# Pick a Primary Technology Path

Although it might be one of the harder decisions you make, you
really need to pick a primary technology focus, a path early on
since other stuff builds on top of it. You can always change the
path later or do both paths, but for now pick either ***Web*** or
***Python***. 

## Python

The *Python* path leads to [*Engineering*][eng], [*Linux*][linux],
[*Programming Languages*][lang], and [*Data Science*][data] focus
categories in the [*Project*][project] courses to follow.

[lang]: http://lang.skilstak.io
[data]: http://data.skilstak.io
[project]: http://project.skilstak.io

Choose *Python* if you love the hacker-feel of nothing but a powerful
command-line running raw code. While Python is still used extensively
for graphic applications and even to serve web sites its primary
use today is for server administration, automation, engineering,
number crunching, and data science. Python is also embedded in lots
of other applications like Photoshop, Blender and others.

The *Python* path takes less time because it is only one language,
not three.

## Web

The *Web* path leads to [*Game*][game], [*Apps*][apps], [*Programming
Languages*][lang], and [*Database*][data] focus categories in the
[*Project*][project] courses.

Choose *Web* if you really enjoy anything graphic, or with moving
graphic parts. Web technology is mostly about front end
presentation, interfaces, and graphic interactivity.

*Web* technology is exploding as more moves the web browser.
Everything from simple web pages and games to complex applications
are being created using web technology today. Web technology can be
found on more devices than any other technology in history.
Web technology is actually three technologies used together:

* Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* JavaScript (JavaScript)

So, yeah, learning web technology takes longer but has a real wide
variety of uses. 

JavaScript is used in [Unity](http://unity3d.com) for 3D game and
simulation development.  Web technology can be used to make full
desktop applications like [Slack](http://slack.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io) with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io). And, of
course, web tech is used for mobile apps more than ever now with
technologies like [React Native][react] and [Phonegap][phonegap].
