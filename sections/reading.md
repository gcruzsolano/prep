# Be Willing and Able to Read, A Lot

![](/assets/reading.gif)

Congratulations you are reading this! In case you haven't noticed
we expect students and parents to read, a lot. Reading is a core
career skill any programmer, technologist, or responsible human
will every learnâ€”especially in this 140-character, TL;DR;,
video-centric world. Today, those who read accurately and quickly
will dominate their domains. These are the distinguished students
(and parents) we want at SkilStak. 

We know everyone is busy. You still need to read, this site,
assignment, mailing list notifications, chat rooms, and lots of
material on the Internet related to what you are learning. Google
and GitHub are your main textbooks. If you find reading painful or
bothersome SkilStak is likely not for you. Start your reading
practice today by making sure you read all of your assignments for
this Prep class.
