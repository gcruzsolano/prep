# Which computer should I get?

This first thing we need to say is you do not have to purchase a new
computer to be a student at SkilStak. You can likely use whatever
computer you already have at home. 

But when holidays and birthdays come up this question gets asked a lot.
Our answer is short, opinionated, and unapologetic:

1. Buy a Mac laptop (Macbook Air or higher if you can) ~ $1800
2. Buy a Mac (Mini, iMac or Pro) ~ $500 — $3000
3. Buy a cheap PC and install [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) ~ $300
4. Buy a Raspberry Pi ([Canakit][]) ~ $80 - $100
5. Install an Ubuntu virtual machine (on a PC) ~ free if you have

[Canakit]: https://amzn.com/B01C6Q2GSY

Options #1 and #2 will put you in sync with SkilStak and professional
tools and workflows immediately. Their experience at home will be
identical to that at SkilStak and later at work and in computer
science programs.

Option #3 is also used at SkilStak and in computer science programs
but is not commonly available to the average consumer and requires
the step of installing Ubuntu Linux Operating System, which is the
most widely supported Linux OS. This option is cheaper than buying
a Mac but requires more setup time.

Option #4 is the same as #3 but cheaper and with no installation to
do. Just trade in your micro SD card for one of ours preloaded with
our custom SkilStak Ubuntu Linux image already on it. You will still
need to find a screen to connect it to (any TV will do) and a keyboard
and a mouse that suits you. This option is also preferred if you plan
on pursuing [*Engineering*](http://eng.skilstak.io) projects.

Option #5 allows you to create a virtual machine that runs as an
application inside of your Windows or Mac OS. You start it up just
like any other application but the application is itself another
machine, another operating system. Doing this is extremely complicated
for the average person to do. Keep in mind that using a virtual
machine takes up more RAM and CPU than a normal application.

## Developers Overwhelmingly Prefer Mac and Linux

Facts:

* Most of the web runs on Linux machines.
* Most of the web is developed on Macs.

SkilStak is focused on helping others learn backend and frontend
engineering. Both of these industry domains are dominated by Mac and
Linux. 

UNIX machines where invented for colleges such as MIT and others
where thousands of users simultaneously worked, emailed and
communicated with IRC chat. In fact, the world wide web was invented
on a UNIX system as was email, FTP and every other major component of
the Internet. Windows was barely functioning as a desktop operating
system at that time.

Linux was designed to model the user experience of UNIX but be
completely free and open source. GNU/Linux is the original and
current accurate name because it combines GNU, which is an open
source port of all the common UNIX commands, and Linux, the kernel
developed by Linux Torvalds. It is not an exaggeration to say the
Internet was invented on UNIX and now runs mostly on Linux.

Once upon a time Mac computers were only preferred by creatives who
needed a highly visual environment. The term Windows was a rip off of
what Apple had produced. 

Something very significant happened when Steve Jobs returned from
NeXT to Apple. He changed the entire underlying operating system.
Under the hood Mac Darwin is now mostly based on the FreeBSD UNIX
operating system Jobs brought over from NeXT when he came back.
This is not Linux but feels very much like it, which is why command
line developers and good system administrators prefer it. **Jobs had the
foresight to see UNIX/LINUX would become the predominant choice of
developers because of the extremely powerful command line.**

Even if you want or need Windows for software and games you can still
get a Mac and Bootcamp it into Windows. The same is *not* true for
a Windows machine.

## So what do you have against Microsoft?

Microsoft dominates 3D at the moment but is a far inferior server
operating system down to the very core mostly because it was not
designed from the very beginning to be a multiuser system. Everything
to allow that has been hacked onto it over the years. In order to
administer a MS server you have to use some sort of graphic terminal
connection. You simply cannot connect directly to a command line
shell. It is absolutely astounding so many enterprise decision makers
have allowed that many MS servers into their architecture.

Today, Microsoft is changing rapidly to comply with the standards
allowing Linux on their Azure cloud and shoe-horning Bash command
line into Windows 10 (for developers only). These are things Mac
and Linux have had for more than 16 years. Yet you still cannot log in
to a Windows machine command line remotely over ssh. There are
products that attempt to allow this, but fundamentally it is not
included.

If you are a gamer or creating anything in 3D you want Windows. A
lot of developers secretly want a killer gaming system and find a
way to justify getting a Windows machine because of it. If that is
you, just own it. [Here is more of the unapologetic truth about why
we find Microsoft a poor
choice.](https://github.com/skilstak/faq/blob/gh-pages/microsoft.md) Be
warned. It might offend you. Why is all this MS bashing in a Prep
course? Because we want you to understand immediately how we feel
so that if you disagree you can decide now to find an alternative
that teaches Microsoft. We never will.
