# Which computer should I get?

This first thing we need to say is you do not have to purchase a new
computer to be a student at SkilStak. You can likely use whatever
computer you already have at home. 

But when holidays and birthdays come up this question gets asked a lot.
Our answer is short, opinionated, and unapologetic:

1. Buy a Mac laptop (Macbook Air or higher if you can) ~ $1800
2. Buy a Mac (Mini, iMac or Pro) ~ $500 — $3000
3. Buy a cheap PC and install [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) ~ $300
4. Buy a Raspberry Pi ([Canakit][]) ~ $80 - $100
5. Install an Ubuntu virtual machine (on a PC) ~ free if you have

[Canakit]: https://amzn.com/B01C6Q2GSY

Options #1 and #2 will put you in sync with SkilStak and professional
tools and workflows immediately. Their experience at home will be
identical to that at SkilStak and later at work and in computer
science programs.

Option #3 is also used at SkilStak and in computer science programs
but is not commonly available to the average consumer and requires
the step of installing Ubuntu Linux Operating System, which is the
most widely supported Linux OS. This option is cheaper than buying
a Mac but requires more setup time.

Option #4 is the same as #3 but cheaper and with no installation to
do. Just trade in your micro SD card for one of ours preloaded with
our custom SkilStak Ubuntu Linux image already on it. You will still
need to find a screen to connect it to (any TV will do) and a keyboard
and a mouse that suits you. This option is also preferred if you plan
on pursuing [*Engineering*](http://eng.skilstak.io) projects.

Option #5 allows you to create a virtual machine that runs as an
application inside of your Windows or Mac OS. You start it up just
like any other application but the application is itself another
machine, another operating system. Doing this is extremely complicated
for the average person to do. Keep in mind that using a virtual
machine takes up more RAM and CPU than a normal application.

## So what do you have against Microsoft?

If you are a Backend Engineer you want Linux. If you are a Frontend
Engineer you want Mac. If you are a gamer or creating anything in
3D you want Windows. [If you want the unapologetic truth about why
we find Microsoft a poor choice, but don’t blame us if you get
offended.](https://github.com/skilstak/faq/blob/gh-pages/microsoft.md)
