# Joining the Slack Chat Room

**The chat room is the most important thing for you to remember
from this class.** Everything else depends on it. **You should check
the chat at least once a week** to stay informed about what is going
on. If you forget how to get to it, go to the home page
([skilstak.io](http://skilstak.io)) and find your location. The
chat room is linked from there. If you have questions about anything
else, where something is, how to do it, if we are open, *everything*
is in there. **Each chat room is private for your location and you
can direct message anyone at the location including students and
staff.**

Slack is the leading chat tool used by businesses, schools,
open source development teams, organizations, and about everything
else. It comes with a great mobile app that makes communication in
chat as easy as text messages. This is no *made-for-education* chat
tool, it's a *real* tool used by professionals, which is the main
reason we require learning it. 

## Get an Invite

Because we use a private repo (for obvious reasons) you'll need an
invite from your instructor, teacher assistant, or location manager.
Here's what it looks like in your in box:
