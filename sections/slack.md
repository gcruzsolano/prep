# Joining the Slack Chat Room

**The chat room is the most important thing for you to remember
from this class.** Everything else depends on it. If you have
questions about anything else, where something is, how to do it, if we
are open, *everything* is in there. **Each chat room is private for your
location and you can direct message anyone at the location including
students and staff.**

Slack is the leading chat tool used by businesses, schools,
open source development teams, organizations, and about everything
else. It comes with a great mobile app that makes communication in
chat as easy as text messages. This is no *made-for-education* chat
tool, it's a *real* tool used by professionals, which is the main
reason we require learning it. 

## Get an Invite

Because we use a private repo (for obvious reasons) you'll need an
invite from your instructor, teacher assistant, or location manager.
Here's what it looks like in your in box:
