# Check the Web Site

Knowing which web site we are talking about is sometimes not obvious.
Maybe this will help

## Main

The main web site is [`skilstak.io`](http://skilstak.io). Going to
[`skilstak.com`](http://skilstak.com) will also work by being
redirected.

## Location

Each location has a unique name that when added to the front of the
`skilstak.io`, (called a sub domain), will get you to your location’s
web site. Each location web site is run by the location manager of
that site and may be different depending on the location.

## Shortcuts

There are a bunch of shortcuts that will auto-complete in your
browser easily once you have visited them. To see them all click
on the anchor icon from `skilstak.io` or just go to
[`shortcuts.skilstak.io`](http://shortcuts.skilstak.io).

Each course and project focus category has it’s own shortcut.

## Personal

After *Prep* you should have a personal web site started. This is
yours to work on however you wish. It will be a `github.io` domain
unless you have setup a custom domain. Make a note of it in your
work repo.
