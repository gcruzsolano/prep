# The Student Pledge

Yeah, that, be nice. That's it. That's the pledge, (which we [borrowed
a bit](https://www.dudebenice.com/)). But case you were wondering
all of the following fall in the "be nice" category:

* Do help people out if they ask are stuck on something

* Do be on time, it sucks for everyone when you are late, really

* Do leave on time, it sucks for everyone when you don't, really

* Do be authentic, no need to lie

* Be respectful

* Take responsibility for your own actions and learning and
  attendance, your mom and dad aren't here. Speak for yourself. Send
  your own email questions. Learn to be independent. It's the nice
  thing to do.

And here are some things that can get you a [strike](policies.md):

* Touching someone else's computer, ever, even if you think it will
  be funny

* Changing anything on a computer except the background (passwords,
  users, etc.)

* Touching other people in class, ever, even if you think it will
  be funny

* Bullying, don't even joke around about bullying, even if you
  think it will be funny

* Disrespect others, even subtly including your friends,
  parents, other students, and your instructor

* Criticizing and putting down others. When someone asks for your
  opinion be nice and be honest

* Using hate speech, symbols, or inappropriate language, jokes, or
  references. Keep everything rated G

* Willful destruction of property or leaving trash around. This
  includes gum under the chairs and tables

* Thinking somehow you are an exception

There's a lot more that falls under "be nice" see if you can think of
others.

And girls? "Dude" is a non-gender-specific term, so yeah, you are
included.
